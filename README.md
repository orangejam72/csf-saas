# NIST CSF 2.0 Profile Assessment Tool

A tool designed to help organizations implement and assess their cybersecurity posture using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**. This application provides a structured approach to:
- Track and manage CSF outcomes
- Assign ownership and stakeholders to controls
- Document observations and findings
- Score current and desired security states
- Export to csv for data visualization in Excel (find a companion Excel template in public/Sample_Artifacts)
- Track remediation progress

The is an open source project, and improvement ideas to drive cyber risk reduction with CSF assessments are welcome from the Simply Cyber and other awesome communities.

## Credit

This tool is based on the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Released in 2024, CSF 2.0 introduces the new GOVERN function and updated guidance for modern cybersecurity challenges. The framework and implementation examples that make up the basis of this assessment are sourced from [NIST.gov](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). We acknowledge and appreciate NIST's work in creating this valuable resource for improving cybersecurity risk management.

### What's New in CSF 2.0

- **New GOVERN Function**: Establishes cybersecurity governance as a foundational element
- **Updated Categories**: 23 categories and 106 subcategories aligned with modern threats
- **Enhanced Supply Chain Security**: Stronger focus on supply chain risk management
- **Broader Applicability**: Designed for all organizations, not just critical infrastructure
- **Enterprise Risk Integration**: Better alignment with enterprise risk management practices

As a demonstration of how to conduct CSF profile assessment, fictional company "Alma Security" is used, inspired by Daniel Miessler's open source Telos project here: https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos/blob/main/corporate_telos.md

## Features

### CSV Import and Export

#### Export CSV

The Export CSV function allows you to:
- Export your entire assessment database to a CSV file
- Include all control details, observations, scores, and action plans
- Generate date-stamped files for version control
- Add it to the companion Excel template for reporting

To export your data, click the "Export CSV" button in the controls view. The file will be automatically downloaded with a filename that includes the current date.

#### Import CSV

The Import CSV function allows you to:
- Import assessment data from a CSV file
- Update your assessment with data from external sources
- Restore from a previous export
- Collaborate by sharing and merging assessment files

**Important Note:** Importing a CSV will overwrite all data currently in the database. Make sure to export your current data first if you want to preserve it. CSV files are particularly useful for creating charts and visualizations in Excel or other spreadsheet applications.

## Navigation

The application includes several key sections:

- **Subcategories**: View and manage all CSF controls
- **Dashboard**: Visualize assessment data and progress
- **Scoring**: Reference the scoring legend and methodology
- **Artifacts**: Audit artifacts with links, to map to CSF subcategories for "test once - assure many" efficiencies
- **User Management**: Manage users involved in the assessment

## Scoring System

The tool uses a scoring system from 0-10 to assess the current and desired state of each control. It comes from the Mastering Cyber Resilience textbook by AKYLADE.

- **0-1.9**: Insecurity - Organization rarely or never implements this control
- **2.0-4.9**: Some Security - Organization sometimes implements this control, but unreliably
- **5.0-5.9**: Minimally Acceptable Security - Organization consistently implements this control with minor flaws
- **6.1-6.9**: Optimized Security - Organization consistently implements this control with great effectiveness
- **7.0-7.9**: Fully Optimized Security - Organization implements this control with fully optimized effectiveness
- **8.1-10.0**: Too Much Security - Organization implements this control at excessive financial cost
